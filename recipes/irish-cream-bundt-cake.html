    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch<br>
                Bundt pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle chopped nuts evenly over the bottom of the pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Combine cake mix and pudding mix in a large bowl. Beat in eggs, Irish cream liqueur, oil,<br>
                and water with an electric mixer on high speed for 5 minutes. Pour batter over nuts in the<br>
                prepared pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean,<br>
                about 1 hour. Let cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                While cake is cooling, make glaze: Combine sugar, butter, and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a<br>
                boil and continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in Irish cream.<br>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Invert cake onto a serving dish. Prick the top and sides of cake with a toothpick. Spoon glaze over the top<br>
                and brush onto the sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze, then repeat until glaze is used up.
