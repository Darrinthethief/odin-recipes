    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Irish champ is similar to colcannon but is made by blending green onions or scallions with creamy mashed potatoes.<br>
        It's great on its own, served steaming hot with extra butter on top, but it's also a perfect side dish for good<br> 
        quality sausages.

    <h3>Ingredients list</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>  
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat<br>
                to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Drain potatoes well, then return to the pot and cover with a clean dish towel. Place the pot over<br>
                very low heat until potatoes are dry, 2 to 3 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, heat the milk and green onion in a saucepan over medium-low heat until warm, 3 to 4 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Once potatoes are dry, add butter and salt; mash with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in warm milk<br>
                mixture until well combined, then season with pepper.
